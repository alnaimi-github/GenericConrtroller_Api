# GenericController.Api
Overview
GenericController.Api is an extensible ASP.NET Core Web API designed to streamline the implementation of CRUD operations for various entities.

It's ideal for developers seeking a robust and maintainable architecture for managing different types of data models.

Features
Generic Repository Pattern: Centralizes common CRUD operations to reduce redundancy and improve maintainability.
Base Controller: A generic controller to handle standard API actions (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for any entity type.
Dependency Injection: Utilizes ASP.NET Core's built-in DI to manage repository instances seamlessly.
Asynchronous Operations: Supports async methods for better performance and scalability.
Entity Framework Core Integration: Uses EF Core for data access, with support for SQL Server.
Logging and Configuration: Preconfigured logging and connection string management for easy setup.
